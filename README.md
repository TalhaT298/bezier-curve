This Python code uses matplotlib to visualize a Bezier curve based on given control points. It defines functions for calculating factorials, combinations, and the Bernstein basis functions for Bezier curves. The main function initializes control points for the curve and generates the Bezier curve points by iterating through parameter values. The curve's progression is visualized dynamically using matplotlib animations. The resulting graph displays both the control points and the evolving Bezier curve. This code serves as a concise and interactive demonstration of Bezier curve generation in Python.
